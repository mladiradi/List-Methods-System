# Python-List-Methods-System

Develop a console-based application that allows users to perform various operations on a list. The application will present a menu of options, each corresponding to a different list method. Users can choose an option by entering a number, and the application will execute the corresponding list method.

âœ… Requirements:
Initial List Input:
Prompt the user to input initial values for the list. These values should be comma-separated.
Menu Display:
Display a list of options for the user, each corresponding to a list method. Allow the user to select an option by entering the associated number.
List Methods to Implement:
append()
extend()
insert()
remove()
pop()
clear()
index()
count()
sort()
reverse()
copy()
User Interaction:
Prompt the user for necessary inputs based on the selected list method.
Display the updated list after each operation.
Include an option to exit the application.
Error Handling:
Handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., non-integer menu choices, out-of-range indices).
Provide meaningful error messages and prompt the user to try again.
Code Structure:
Use functions to organize the code (e.g., separate functions for displaying the menu, handling each list method, etc.).
Ensure the code is modular, readable, and well-documented.
