Develop a console-based application that allows users to perform various operations on a list. The application will present a menu of options, each corresponding to a different list method. Users can choose an option by entering a number, and the application will execute the corresponding list method.


##Key Features and Explanation

    Menu Display:
        The display_menu function presents the list of available operations to the user.

    List Operations:
        Each list method is implemented in its own function, allowing for easy modification and readability.
        handle_append, handle_extend, handle_insert, handle_remove, handle_pop, handle_clear, handle_index, handle_count, handle_sort, handle_reverse, and handle_copy implement the respective list operations, taking user input as needed.

    User Interaction:
        The main function loops indefinitely until the user chooses to exit.
        It prompts the user to enter their choice and calls the corresponding function.

    Error Handling:
        The code includes error handling for common issues like invalid input types and index out of range, providing feedback to the user.
        Uses try and except to handle exceptions gracefully.

    Modularity:
        Each operation is encapsulated within its function, making the code modular and easy to maintain or extend.

##Additional Notes

    Data Types:
        The list operations assume that all inputs are strings since they are split from a comma-separated input string. If numerical operations are required, additional input parsing and validation may be necessary.
    Sort and Reverse:
        The sort and reverse operations modify the list in place. Sorting assumes comparable data types.

##This program serves as a practical application of various list operations, providing a simple user interface for managing and manipulating lists.
